\begin{abstract}
For the card game \SET, the exact probabilities of all possible numbers of SETs
can be determined analytically for deals of small numbers of cards, and can be
enumerated exhaustively for somewhat larger numbers. But for 12 cards (the
starting number of cards according to the rules of \SET) combinatorial explosion
has so far prohibited direct enumeration, allowing only estimation of
probabilities by simulation. In this result, massively parallel programming on a
Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) is used to exhaustively enumerate all possible
deals of up to 12 cards, in about 100 hours. In particular, the probability that
an opening deal of 12 \SETb cards does not contain a SET is exactly
$2284535476080/70724320184700 \approx 3.2302\%$.

\section{Introduction}
In the card game \SET\cite{SET}, each card depicts 4 attributes, and each
attribute (number, texture, color, shape) has 3 possible values, for a total of
$3^4=81$ cards. A `SET' is defined as a set\footnote{A note on terminology:
  \SETb will refer to the card game, `SET' will refer to a SET according to the
  rules of the game, and 'set' will take its normal mathematical sense of an
  unordered collection.} of 3 cards for which are either all the same, or all
different, in each attribute. As such, the card game is equivalent to the finite
geometry AG(4,3) (4 dimensions, 3 values); cards are analogous to points, and
SETs are lines (sets of collinear points).

Extending the geometric analogy, just as 3 non-collinear points determine a
plane (and all the lines between points in the plane lie in the plane), a
'plane' in \SETb can be built from 3 cards which do not form a SET, by adding
cards which form SETs with 2 previous cards. Closure will be reached at 9 cards,
at which point for any two cards, the third card which completes a SET with them
will also be present. The number of SETs in a plane is 12. See \cite{JOS} for
extensive discussion of planes, hyperplanes, and the relationship between \SETb
and affine geometry in general.

Another equivalent formulation, is that cards are 4-tuples from the set
$\{0,1,2\}^4$, and a SET is three cards such that their sum is $\equiv (0,0,0,0)
\pmod 3$. Even more briefly, the 4-tuples can be represented by 4-digit numbers
in base 3; the 81-cards in the \SETb deck are represented by ternary numbers
0000, 0001, 0002, 0010, \ldots 2222. A fundamentally important fact about SETs
is that, for any two distinct cards, there is a unique third card which
completes a SET with them. To find it, set each attribute/digit of the third
card appropriately so that each digit sum is $\equiv 0 \pmod 3$.

The rules of \SETb specify that a game begins by dealing 12 cards. As long as no
SET is present, 3 more cards are dealt. So the question naturally arises, what
is the probability that 12 cards have no SET? Or more generally, {\bf What is
  the probability distribution of all possible numbers of SETs that 12 cards may
  contain?} That is the question addressed by this work.

If the initial deal has no SETs, additional cards are dealt (three at a time)
until a SET is found. How far could this process go? It is known that the
largest possible collection of cards with no SET is 20, so in the vanishingly
unlikely case that a game of SET reaches 21 cards, there will definitely be a
SET. It turns out that this question was answered before the game of \SETb was
invented. The affine geometry analogue of a maximal collection of SET cards with
no SET is called a `maximal cap', and in 1971 it was proven that the size of
maximal caps in AG(4,3) is 20 \cite{MAXCAP}. This provides a useful bound for
how far to extend analysis of how many cards contain how many SETs; larger
numbers of cards can never occur in a (well-played) game of \SET.

\section{Previous Results}
A complete enumeration must consider $\binom{81}{12} \approx 7\times 10^{13}$
cases. McMahon, Gordon et al note (\cite{JOS} p.~259) that, even though their
computer program can process about 100 million deals per hour, a complete
enumeration would still take 80 years. Enumeration, they note, ``might be
feasible with streamlined code and faster machines or parallel processing.''

Donald Knuth tackled the more specific problem of counting how many deals have 0
SETs. Knuth achieves tremendous speedup over exhaustive enumeration by using
``isomorph rejection'' (i.e. `streamlined code'). Knuth called his program to
find SETless $k$-sets, \SETSET \cite{SETSET}. 

For instance, using the 4-digit ternary representation, the first 1-card deal is
$\{0000\}$. That does not contain a SET, and there are 81 total 1-card deals
which do not have SETs because they are isomorphic to the first one. Because the
other 80 1-card sets are isomorphic to the first, \SETSET didn't need to enumerate
them. Similarly, \SETSET determined that there are 3240 SETless 2-sets, comprised of
4 isomorphism groups, by inspecting only 4 representative cases; and there are
84240 SETless 3-sets, in 16 isomorphism groups, so only 16 specific cases need
to be enumerated. In total, \SETSET was able to account for
$\Sigma_{k=1}^{21}\binom{81}{k}\approx 1.6\times 10^{13}$ SETless $k$-sets by
inspecting only $5.14\times 10^8$ cases, and avoiding inspection of isomorphic
cases. Running \SETSET on an iCore 7 ?? takes about four and a half hours. 

%For 2-card sets, again the first case $\{0000,
%0001\}$ is SETless, and by isomorphism represents all 2-sets, knocking off all
%$\binom{81}{2}=3240$ 2-sets by inspecting just the 1 case. And for 3 cards, the
%first case $\{0000, 0001, 0002\}$ is a SET, so it is ignored. The next case
%$\{0000, 0001, 0010\}$ is not a set (therefore does not contain a SET), and is
%in an isomorphism group of size 84240. 

Later, Knuth improved on his the solution in \SETSET by expanding the size of
his isomorphism groups, thus requiring the consideration of fewer representative
cases. The revised version was called \SETSETA\cite{SETSET-ALL}.  The 4-card
case is illustrative. Knuth writes of the slower \SETSET for the 4-card case:
\begin{quote}
  The total number of such [SETless] sets is 1516320 + 63180 = 1579500, a number
  that the \SETSET program was able to compute only after it had laboriously
  considered 128 cases that were nonisomorphic in the previous setup.
\end{quote}
\SETSETA found just 2 isomorphism groups (cases) of SETless 4-sets. Because of
its larger isomorphism groups, \SETSETA is able to complete the analysis by
consider many fewer representative cases. Compared to the $5.14\times 10^8$
cases evaluated by \SETSET, \SETSETA dealt with only 9906 cases, and thus runs
(on the same hardware) in only 3m45s.

%% Knuth's enumeration of sets of 4 cards goes no further than $\{0000, 0001, 0010,
%% 0011\}$ and $\{0000, 0001, 0010, 0100\}$.\footnote{Note card 0002 is omitted in
%%   these sets, because it forms a set with 0000 and 0001.}  Those sets determine
%% isomorphism groups of 63180 and 1516320 no-SET 4-sets, respectively. Knuth is
%% able to prune the 4-card enumeration beyond that point by determining that all
%% remaining 4-sets either is isomorphic to one of those two, or contains a SET. So
%% there are exactly $63180+1516320=1579500$ of all possible
%% $\binom{81}{4}=1663740$ 4-sets contain no SET. That leaves 1080 4-sets.


For small cases (3, 4, and 5 cards) it is straightforward to achieve these
results analytically. For 3 and 4 cards, there are either 0 SETs, or there is 1
SET. But for 5, the possibility arises for either one or two SETs. \SETSET
determines (along with the analytical method) that there are 22441536 5-sets
with no SETs, but as it is focused on 0-SET cases only, it does not divide the
remaining $\binom{81}{5}-22441536=19261476$ 5-sets into 3116880 with 1 SET and
63180 with 2 SETs (\SETSET search is pruned at whatever depth a first SET is
encountered).

\SETSET's analysis of the 0-SET problem is complete, in that it provides counts
of 0-SET $k$-sets for $k$ up to 21 (at which point 0 SET cases are impossible).
In particular, \SETSET provides a value of 2284535476080 SETless 12-sets, which
our enumeration will match, as well as providing the number of 12-sets which
have 1 SET, 2 SETs, etc.


\section{Implementation}
This paper picks up the implicit challenge of McMahon and Gordon to code the
12-card enumeration with streamlined code and parallel processing (although not
necessarily faster machines). Source code is available on github \cite{ME}. The
code can be run serially, or in parallel using threads or OpenCL \cite{OPENCL}
kernels. Note that OpenCL can be configured so that its kernels can be
parallelized onto either CPU or GPU resources.

For each set of $k$ cards, all $\binom{k}{3}$ triples need to be checked for
whether they constitute a SET. Knuth notes, ``We will frequently need to find
the third card of a SET, given any two distinct cards $x$ and $y$, so we store
the answers in a precomputed table.''  This is an immense computational savings
compared to 4 sums and 4 modulo 3's for each SET determination, so that practice
was adopted here as well.

Sets of $k$ cards (`$k$-sets') are enumerated according to a combinatorial
numbering system. In the first iteration of the enumeration program, each
combination number from 0 to $\binom{81}{k}-1$ was fully `unranked' to a
$k$-combination using the algorithm presented in \cite{WIKI}. In order to unrank
an combinatorial number $N$ into $k$ specific cards, the algorithm requires, for
each of the $k$ cards, a number of comparisons to $\binom{n}{k}$, for $n\le 81,
k\le 12$. To avoid $O(k)$ computation each for each binomial coefficient, those
values were also precomputed and stored in a lookup table. The number of lookups
of $\binom{n}{k}$ required to unrank a particular number $N$ varies. The fixed
number of 81 cards establishes a generous upper bound on the possible number of
lookups per card being unranked, and the minimum number of steps is 1. Since the
number of steps for each of the $k$ cards is betwen 1 and 81, the complexity of
this unranking algorithm is $O(k)$. The code was temporarily instrumented to
count steps, and it was empirically determined that the constant for this linear
complexity (the average number of $\binom{n}{k}$ lookups for unranking a
$k$-set) is $C\approx 45$. (This could be improved by switching the incremental
searching of the binomial table to binary searching, but the need for
non-branching code (see immediately below) obviates this computational approach
anyways.)

Later, a combination-incrementing algorithm was implemented, with no branching
(GPU programs are most efficient if there are no {\tt if} or {\tt while}
statements, because simultaneous kernels execute the same line of code together,
and kernels that take different paths through the code have to wait for each
other). Instead of fully-unranking each combination from its enumeral number, we
reuse the previous combination by incrementing it to the next combination in the
series. Because of the avoidance of branching, the combination-increment
algorithm takes exactly the same number of steps to increment any
combination. The algorithm executes 5 lines of code for each of the $k$ cards in
the combination, so the incrementing algorithm is also $O(k)$. The algorithm is
not 9x faster, however, since the 5 lines are more complex than the simple steps
taken in the above unranking algorithm. Empirically, the speedup from switching
to full unranking to incrementation was 2-3x (even serially).

The goal for this paper was to enumerate 12-card deals, which requires
enumeration of combinations numbered by integers as large as $\binom{81}{12}-1
\approx 7\times 10^{13}$. For this purpose, an unsigned 64-bit integer
suffices. Fortunately, the latest advances in GPU technology have recently
introduced native capabilty for 64-bit integer types. Also fortuitous is the
fact that, since $2^{64} > \binom{81}{21}$, 64-bit unsigned integers suffice all
the way up to deals of 21 cards, which is the same extent as Knuth's programs
analyzed (since 20 is the size of the maximal cap -- there are configurations of
20 cards without SETs, and $k=21$ is the minimal deal size for which the number
of 0-SET deals is 0).

This problem is `embarassingly parallel': counting the number of sets in any
combination of cards is completely independent of any other. What's more, the
input is merely a number (or two numbers defining a range), and the output a
small array of accumulators, counting how many $k$-sets in the range have 0
SETs, 1 SET, \ldots 14 SETs (it is known that 14 is the maximum number of SETs
that can occur in 12 cards \cite{VINCI}). Each kernel can have its own small
array of counters, to avoid write contention, and the counter arrays can be then
quickly summed.

\section{Results}
The exhaustive enumeration program was run for $3<=k<=12$. The results are
presented in Table \ref{THE_TABLE}. Runtimes are for GPU processing on an
NVIDIA Quadro P4000. Non-rigorous trial and error determined that a decent
setting for the GPU processing was to queue 5000 kernels at a time, each tasked
with enumerating a batch of 10000 $k$-combinations.



The 12-set enumeration took 90.1h=3.75d. The total time for $k=3\ldots 12$ was
104.5h=4.35d. (Because of combinatorial explosion, the 12-card enumeration
consumed the lion's share of processing.) The 12-card processing rate was 218M
deals/second, and the overall rate was 226M/second (slightly higher because each
$k<12$-combination required checking $\binom{k<12}{3}$ triples,
etc). Single-threaded on a core i7 2.8GHz CPU (?), the 12-card enumeration ran
at 842K/s (projected exhaustive enumeration time 972d=2.66y). Thus GPU
processing yielded a 218M/842k$\approx$256x speedup (at least comparing these specific
processors). However, the Quadro P4000 has 1792 cores, so it seems possible that
the GPU processing could be further optimized to obtain a 12-card enumeration
time well under 24 hours. Enumeration for $k=13$ or maybe 14 may become
worthwhile, but combinatorial explosion quickly wins again, as runtimes increase
about 7x for each larger $k$. Perhaps Knuth's isomorphism rejection technique
could be extended to counting not just 0-SET deals, making a complete
enumeration of up to $k=81$ possible.

A number of interesting features arise from the full pattern of counts. The
value of 84240 shows up 4 times, 3032640 three times, and 160729920 twice. This
invites questions such as, is there a meaningful bijection between the 9-sets
with 5 SETs, and the 12-sets with 11 SETs? Or is it just a coincidence from
reuse of the same prime factors?


There are a number of gaps in the table indicating impossible numbers of SETs
for some set sizes. The first gap shows that 7 cards cannot have 1, 2, 3, or 5,
but not exactly 4 SETs. Although there are 84240 6-sets with 3 SETs, there is no
way to add a $7^{th}$ card and complete only one more SET.\footnote{And yet
  there are 42120 7-sets with 5 SETs -- do they correspond with half of the
  84240 3-SET 6-sets for a meaningful reason? Or do some of the result from
  adding a card to a 6-set with fewer than 3 SETs, and completing more than 2
  new SETs?}

The gaps in the 9-set enumeration are quite interesting. The 1170 9-sets with 12
SETs are all possible planes (this matches the analytical result obtained in
\cite{JOS}, p.~48). It is possible for 9 cards to have 8 SETs, as explained by
Liz McMahon:\footnote{Co-author of \cite{JOS}, personal correspondence}
\begin{quote}
If you take a plane [12 SETs] and remove one card, what’s left has 8 SETs.  You
can then add another point that doesn’t complete any more SETs, and that gives
you the 8 SETs in 9 cards.
\end{quote}
Between 8 and 12 SETs though, no intermediate number of SETs is possible for 9
cards.

Every occurrence of a gap for $k$ cards is followed by a gap in the $k+1$ cards
series that is smaller by one.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \center{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cols.png}}
  \caption{\label{FIGROWS} Each curve is one number of SETs (table row); x is
    deal size, y is probability}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \center{\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rows.png}}
  \caption{\label{FIGCOLS} Each curve is one deal size (table column); x is
    number of SETs, y is probability}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{FIGROWS} and \ref{FIGCOLS} graph the tabular data by rows and by
columns, and also demonstrate some interesting features. Both graphs normalize
the tabular data into probabilities (dividing by $\binom{81}{k}$), otherwise
each deal size would have numbers of such different orders of magnitude that the
data would not be visually comparable.

In Figure \ref{FIGROWS}, each curve represents the probability of a certain
number of SETs (one row of the table). The horizontal axis is the number of
cards dealt, and the vertical axis is probability. The 0 SETs curve starts at
$84240/85320\approx 98.7\%$ for 3 cards, and only decreases as more cards are
dealt. If the graph were extended to a deal size of $k=21$, the 0 SETs curve
would reach $0\%$ exactly, but within this range it decreases at $k=12$ to
$2284535476080/70724320184700\approx 3.23\%$ (the figure of most interest to
players of \SET).

The 1-SET curve shows that the probability of exactly 1 SET increases for a
while are more cards are dealt, but peaks at $k=9$, and then falls off as it
becomes more likely that 2 or more SETs will occur. The 2 SET curve peaks at
$k=11$. The 3 SET curve reaches its maximum within this range at $k=12$, it is
not obvious whether it peaks there or continues to rise, but non-exhaustive
random sampling simulation would determine that pretty quickly.

(Some of the interesting smaller probabilities cannot be discerned from this
linear scale graph, TBD log scale graph shows more interesting features.)

Figure \ref{FIGCOLS} graphs each column of the table as one curve. The
horizontal axis is number of SETS, and the vertical axis is again
probability. The $k=3$ curve (highest on the left) and $k=4$ curves have only
two datapoints each, as the only possibilities for those cases are 0 SETs or 1
SET. $k=5$ introduces the possibility of two SETs, and thus a third data
point. At $k=9$ is the smallest deal size for which 0 SETs is not the most
likely outcome. For $k=12$ of interest to players of \SET, the most likely
occurrences are 3 SETs at 27.25\%, and 2 SETs almost 26.10\%, together
accounting for a small majority of 12-card deals.

(Interesting smaller probabilities shown in log graph, as well as removing
points for gaps)



\section{Conclusion}
This paper improves on the speed of enumeration of starting deals for the card
game \SET, to accomplish exhaustive enumeration for up to 12 cards, in a little
over 4 days. As the marginal factor for extra time spent appears to be
converging to about 7x for each additional card, the same hardware and software
could enumerate 13, 14, and 15 cards should be about a month, 7 months, and 4
years, respectively. To reach a complete analysis at 21 cards, computational
power would have to grow by many orders of magnitude; or an analytical or
non-exhaustive enumerative solution would have to be devised (perhaps along the
lines of Donald Knuth's enumerations of just the 0-SET problem).
